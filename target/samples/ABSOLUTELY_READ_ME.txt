USE THESE SAMPLE TARGETS AT YOUR OWN RISK
=========================================

You are responsible for your own actions.

The IP addresses provided in these sample
targets are all public. That is, they are
all easily attainable via a tracert /
traceroute / google search.

With great power comes great
responsibility. If you mess with anyone's
host they do have the power to take
action against you. That action can range
from a temporary ban to legal action for
damages caused. Be smart. Be safe.

USE THESE SAMPLE TARGETS AT YOUR OWN RISK
=========================================

Each sample file will start with the
routine that is safe to use against it
ONLY ONCE.

E.G.

ping_target.json is safe to ping ONCE
post_target.sjon is safe to POST to ONCE
tracert_target.json is safe to tracert ONCE
